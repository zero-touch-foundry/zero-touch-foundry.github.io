## What is a Stack Automation blueprint?
A blueprint is a template for provisioning a deployment that contains references to different IaC Components ("Grains") that together define the applications, cloud infrastructure, networking and policies that make up a specific deployment. Blueprints are stored as source-controlled YAML files, and each grain in a blueprint is a reference to one IaC or automation file (for example, a Terraform module or a Helm chart) that will be deployed as part of the deployment, and the component's designated inputs, outputs and execution information. 

A blueprint also contains the orchestration between the grains (provisioning order and dependencies, shared parameter storage, deployment duration policies, tag values, etc.), and when launched, deploys a whole stack, from the infrastructure layer to the application itself. 

There are three ways to end up with a blueprint in Stack Automation: let Stack Automation wrap a discovered IaC asset for you behind the scenes (Option A), author a multi-grain blueprint YAML yourself in your source control repository (Option B), or build one visually using the Designer Canvas (Option C).

## Option A: Let Stack Automation wrap your assets for self-service
Once a repository is connected and its assets are discovered (see [Discover Your Assets](/getting-started/asset-discovery)), each discovered IaC asset appears in your space's **Assets** page. From there, you can make any asset (or an existing blueprint) available for self-service consumption with two independent toggles:

- **Solution Hub**: makes the item visible in the Solution Hub catalog so other users in the space can launch it.
- **Building Block**: makes the item available as a reusable component inside the visual blueprint designer (see [Option C](#option-c-build-a-blueprint-visually-in-the-designer-canvas) below).

Enabling either toggle on a raw IaC asset wraps it in a blueprint behind the scenes. You don't see or edit that generated blueprint's YAML directly — instead, you customize the asset's display name, icon, and labels through its own **Solution Hub Design** screen. If you enable the same toggles directly on a full blueprint (one created via Option B or C), you get the complete set of blueprint-level controls: Instructions, consumption Policies, Labels, and Tags, in addition to Display Name and Icon.

1. In your space, go to **Automation > Assets** and open the **IaC Assets** tab to see everything discovered from your connected repositories.
2. Toggle **Solution Hub** for any asset you want end-users to be able to launch from the catalog, and/or toggle **Building Block** for any asset you want to make reusable when building blueprints visually.
3. Click into the asset to open its **Solution Hub Design** screen, where you can set its Display Name, Category Icon, and Labels, and preview how it will appear as a catalog card.

You and your space's users can now launch deployments from these items via the **Solution Hub** catalog.

## Option B: Create a multi-asset blueprint in your source control repository
So far, we've learned how self-service wrapping works for single-asset items. But what if you want to create an application-stack deployment? This is easily done by having multiple grains in a single blueprint or nesting an existing blueprint within a master blueprint as a grain. To create such a blueprint, you will need an IDE environment that has access to a clone of your repository, in which you can create the new blueprint's YAML file and edit it, and then commit it into your repository and push the changes to the remote repository from which Stack Automation will automatically synchronize the new blueprint.

By enforcing usage of a source control repository, each blueprint in Stack Automation will have:
* A full history of tracked changes
* The ability to identify which developer authored those changes
* The ability to retrieve or rollback to the contents of previous versions of the blueprint file

:::tip __Tips__
* When connecting a repository containing blueprint files to Stack Automation, it is possible to reference a branch of the repository and not its main, allowing designers the ability to test changes to blueprints before pushing them to the main/master branch and affecting the production catalog. 
:::

__To create a multi-asset blueprint:__
1. For each grain, do one of the following:
   * Copy an example of that grain from a generated blueprint or from the documentation.
   * Use the sample structure for that grain type in the corresponding page in [The Blueprint YAML](/blueprint-designer-guide/blueprints/blueprints-overview).
2. If grains depend on each other, add a ```depends-on``` section to the grain (in the top level, next to ```kind:``` and ```spec:```) and provide the names of the dependent grains in a comma-separated list. 
3. Once a grain depends on another grain, the output values from that grain can be used as values for any of the grain's inputs or attributes using the syntax ```{{ .grains.grain_name.outputs.output_name}}```, see the examples below. 
4. Customize the ```inputs``` and ```outputs``` sections of the blueprint to contain only the relevant inputs that the entire deployment needs, and to reflect the outputs from the grains that you would like to make available to the deployment's end-user.

## Option C: Build a blueprint visually in the Designer Canvas
Beyond hand-writing YAML, Stack Automation also provides a visual, drag-and-drop way to build multi-grain blueprints: the **Designer Canvas**.

1. Mark the IaC assets you want to reuse as **Building Block** components first (see [Option A](#option-a-let-stack-automation-wrap-your-assets-for-self-service)) — only assets with this toggle enabled can be dragged onto the canvas.
2. Go to **Automation > Assets > Blueprints** and click **New Blueprint**.
3. Choose **Custom Blueprint** to start from a blank canvas, or pick one of the pre-built infrastructure pattern templates if your space has any configured.
4. Give the blueprint a name, an optional description, and a default management server (used to automatically populate every grain's agent input), then click **Create**.
5. On the **Designer Canvas**, click the **Add Grains** button to open the Building Blocks Library, then add your Building-Block-marked assets onto the canvas as grains, connect them to define dependencies, and configure each grain's inputs and outputs directly in the UI.
6. Switch to the **Blueprint YAML** tab at any time to view the underlying YAML — since this blueprint is backend-stored (not yet pushed to a repository), you can also edit the YAML directly here.
7. Use the blueprint's **Overview**, **Instructions**, and **Policies** tabs to configure its Solution Hub/Building Block visibility, end-user instructions, and consumption policies.

## Removing a blueprint
As mentioned above, there are two types of blueprints, blueprints stored in Stack Automation (whether wrapped automatically via Option A or built visually via Option C) and source-controlled blueprints (stored in your repository, per Option B). 

* To delete a stored-in-Stack-Automation Blueprint, in the **Blueprints** tab, click on the Blueprint and then click the __Delete__ button on the top right corner.
* To delete a "repository" Blueprint, simply delete the blueprint file from the repository's branch that the Stack Automation space is connected to.
