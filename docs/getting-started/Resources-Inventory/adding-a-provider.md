# Adding a Provider

Use **+ Add Provider** (top right of the inventory) to launch the two-step Add Provider wizard.

## Step 1 — Provider Details

Select the **provider type** and supply core identity and sharing settings.

1. **Choose a provider type.** Select from Intersight, Azure, AWS, vCenter, Kubernetes, GCP, or Custom. You can also start from a Sample. The selected type determines which capabilities become available in Step 2.
2. **Provider Alias Name.** Enter a unique, human-readable name. This alias appears in the inventory list and wherever the provider is referenced as a target.
3. **Connected Space(s).** Toggle **Share with all spaces**, or select specific spaces. Any blueprint in a connected space can use this provider's content.
4. **Labels (optional).** Add or create `key:value` labels to organize and later filter providers.
5. **Advanced Permission Options.** Choose how credentials are scoped:
   - **Single Credentials Set** — use the same credential set for both Discovery and Deploy capabilities.
   - **Multiple Credentials Set** — use different credential sets for Discovery and Deploy, for least-privilege separation.

## Step 2 — All Capabilities

Configure the capabilities the chosen provider type supports. Depending on the type, this includes enabling **Discovery** and/or **Deploy**, supplying endpoint and credential details, and optionally validating connectivity before saving.

- Enable the capabilities you want this provider to expose.
- Provide the credentials required by each enabled capability (one set, or separate sets, per the Step 1 choice).
- Test connectivity to confirm the provider is reachable and the credentials are valid.
- Save to add the provider to the inventory.

| Azure | Yes | Yes | Cloud objects (compute, storage, networking) |
| GCP | Yes | Yes | Cloud objects (compute, storage, networking) |
| vCenter | Yes | Yes | Virtual machines, datastores, networks |
| Kubernetes | Yes | Yes | Clusters, namespaces, workloads |
| Intersight | Yes | Yes | Blades, Rack Units, chassis, server profiles |
