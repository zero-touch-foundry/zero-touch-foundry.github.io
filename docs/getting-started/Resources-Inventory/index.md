# Overview

Stack Automation Resources Inventory gives you a single, governed view of every infrastructure and cloud endpoint your organization connects to. Each entry in the inventory is a **provider** — a connection to a cloud account, virtualization platform, Kubernetes cluster, or infrastructure controller — that doubles as a **target** for discovery and deployment operations.

Providers are typed on creation (for example AWS, Azure, vCenter, Intersight, Kubernetes, GCP, or Custom). A provider's type determines which **capabilities** it can offer. The two core capabilities are:

- **Discovery** — the provider can be scanned to enumerate the resources it manages (for example blades, rack units, virtual machines, or cloud objects), which are then browsable inside the inventory.
- **Deploy** — the provider can be used as a target for deploying blueprints and launching deployments.

The inventory surface aggregates health and distribution metrics across all providers so operators can quickly assess coverage, spot unhealthy connections, and understand which capabilities are active across the estate.

## Key concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Provider** | A connection to an external system (cloud, virtualization, Kubernetes, infrastructure controller). Each provider is also a deployment target. |
| **Provider Type** | The category selected at creation (AWS, Azure, vCenter, Intersight, Kubernetes, GCP, Custom). Determines available capabilities. |
| **Capability** | A function a provider exposes — primarily Discovery and Deploy. Availability depends on provider type and configuration. |
| **Resource** | An individual item discovered under a provider (e.g., a Blade, Rack Unit, VM, or cloud object). |
| **Deployment Space** | The space(s) a provider is shared with; controls which blueprints can use the provider's content. |
| **Capability Health** | A rolled-up indicator of how many providers have a working Discovery or Deploy capability. |
